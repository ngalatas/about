The questionnaire is for distribution by a movie rental company to their customers. The questions have no clear order, but the most important information to the company appears to come first in the survey. Creating more skips for irrelevant questions and reordering the questions would be beneficial. This would make it such that if someone does not own a DVD player in question 3, they do not have to answer again in question 10."
