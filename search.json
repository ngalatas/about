Here are some of the many tasks I performed while with them:\n\nPublishing an Article\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the article here!\n\n\n\nWhile working at NCSL, I was lucky enough to help out with many projects and tasks. One of those was the opportunity to publish a summary article of a brief by Andrew Smalley, who I interned under. This covers some of the recent efforts done by states to make more efficient workforce systems.\n\n\n\nTracking Postsecondary Legislation\nMy primary task working at NCSL was to track and categorize state legislation for higher education and workforce efforts. I tracked around 2000 pieces of legislation in topic areas ranging from dual enrollment to financial aid. Look through the legislation below:\n\n\n\nClick here to access the database!\n\n\n\n\nStudent Loan Database\n\n\n\n\n\nLook through Student Loan Legislation here!\n\n\n\nOne other database I tracked legislation for as an intern was our Student Loan Bill Tracking Database. This takes the legislation passed and categorizes it further in a Power BI database to break down forgiveness, licensure, oversight, and tax bills into their own groupings. Check it out!"
